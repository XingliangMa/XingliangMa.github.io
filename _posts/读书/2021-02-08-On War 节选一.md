#### *Book One - Information In War*
__A great part of the information obtained in war is contradictory, a still greater part is false, and by far the greatest part somewhat doubtful.__


#### *Book Three - Boldness*
The higher we ascend in positions of command, the more will mind, intellect and insight predominate in activity, and the more, therefore, will boldness, which is a property of temperament, be thrust into the background. For that reason we find it so rarely in the higest positions; but it is then all the more worthy of admiration. 

__Boldness, directed by a predominating intelligence, is the stamp of the hero__: this boldness does not consist in venturing directly against the nature of things, in a downright violation of the laws of probability, but in the forceful support of the higher calculation which genius, with its instinctive judgement, has run through with lightning speed, and but half consciously, when it makes its choice. The more boldness lends wings to the mind and insight, so much the higher these will reach in their flight, and so much the more comprehensive will be the vision, and the more correct the result; but of course only on the assumption that with greater objects greater dangers are associated.

The ordinary man, not to speak of the weak and irresolute, arrives at a correct result in so far as such is possible without living experience, while pursuing, at most, an imaginary activity in his study, far away from danger and responsibility. Let danger and responsibility surround him from every direction, and he loses his perspective and if he retains this in any measure by the influence of others, still he would lose his power of making decision, because in that point no one can help him.
