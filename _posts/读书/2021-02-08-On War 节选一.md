__A great part of the information obtained in war is contradictory, a still greater part is false, and by far the greatest part somewhat doubtful.__ 
...
This difficulty of seeing things correctly, which is one of the greatest sources of friction in war, makes things appear quite different from what was expected. The impression of the senses is stronger than the force of the ideas resulting from deliberate calculation, and this goes so far that probably no scheme of any importance has ever been executed without the commander in the first moments of its execution having had to conquer fresh doubts in his mind. Ordinary men, who follow the suggestions of others, generally, therefore, become undecided on the field of action; they think they have found the circumstances different from what they had expected, all the more so, indeed, since here again they give way to the suggestions of others. But even the man who has made his own plans, when he comes to see things with his own eyes, easily loses faith in his former opinion. Firm reliance upon himself must make him proof against the apparent pressure of the moment; his first conviction will in the end prove true, when the foreground of scenery which fate pushes on to the stage of war with its exaggerated shapes of danger is drawn aside and the horizon extended. This is one of the great gulfs that separate conception from execution. &nbsp;&nbsp;  *(Book One - Information In War)*

The higher we ascend in positions of command, the more will mind, intellect and insight predominate in activity, and the more, therefore, will boldness, which is a property of temperament, be thrust into the background. For that reason we find it so rarely in the higest positions; but it is then all the more worthy of admiration. 
__Boldness, directed by a predominating intelligence, is the stamp of the hero__: this boldness does not consist in venturing directly against the nature of things, in a downright violation of the laws of probability, but in the forceful support of the higher calculation which genius, with its instinctive judgement, has run through with lightning speed, and but half consciously, when it makes its choice. The more boldness lends wings to the mind and insight, so much the higher these will reach in their flight, and so much the more comprehensive will be the vision, and the more correct the result; but of course only on the assumption that with greater objects greater dangers are associated.
The ordinary man, not to speak of the weak and irresolute, arrives at a correct result in so far as such is possible without living experience, while pursuing, at most, an imaginary activity in his study, far away from danger and responsibility. Let danger and responsibility surround him from every direction, and he loses his perspective and if he retains this in any measure by the influence of others, still he would lose his power of making decision, because in that point no one can help him. &nbsp;&nbsp; *(Book Three - Boldness)*
