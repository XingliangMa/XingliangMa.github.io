A great part of the information obtained in war is contradictory, a still greater part is false, and by far the greatest part somewhat doubtful.

*Book One - Information In War*

Boldness, directed by a predominating intelligence, is the stamp of the hero: this boldness does not consist in venturing directly against the nature of things, in a downright violation of the laws of 
probability, but in the forceful support of the higher calculatio which genius, with its instinctive judgement, has run through with lightning speed, and but half 
consciously, when it makes its choice. 
The more boldness lends wings to the mind and insight, so much the higher these will reach in their flight, and so much the more comprehensive will be the vision, and the more 
correct the result; but of course only on the assumption that with greater objects greater dangers are associated.
*Book Three - Boldness*
